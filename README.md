#Project 1: Storm Viewer

ViewController
viewload() is called when the screen has loaded and is ready for you to customize.

didReceiveMemoryWarning() is called when the system is running low on resources, and you're expected to release any RAM you don't need any more.

let is a constant

FileManager.default - work with file system (CRUD)

Bundle.main.resourcePath - where you find files, add to your app

items = try! fm.contentsOfDirectory(atPath: path) -  load the items from the path

try! has potential to go wrong!
